Welcome to my **React Projects Collection** — a hi-tech playground where I experiment, build, and break stuff with React ⚡.  
Think of this as my **React laboratory**: a place for small experiments, mini-apps, and fun learning projects.

## 💻 About This Repo
This repo is designed for **React enthusiasts and curious devs** who like to peek into real code:  

- Each project lives in its **own isolated folder** with its own README and instructions.  
- All projects use **modern React features**:
  - Functional components  
  - Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
  - Component composition  
  - Minimal CSS (sometimes with a bit of flair 💅)  
- No project dependencies interfere — each one is standalone.  
- Designed to be **copy-paste friendly**, so you can fork or experiment freely.  

> Warning ⚠️: May cause extreme curiosity and a sudden urge to type `npm start` 😎
